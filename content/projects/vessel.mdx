- One-command deployment for React and Flutter apps
- Auto-generated production-optimized Nginx configuration
- Docker-based containerization for consistent deployments
- Built-in security headers and performance optimization
- Integrated vulnerability scanning via PensarAI
- WSL Docker installation automation
- Simple deployment management commands

## Overview

Vessel is a powerful command-line tool that simplifies the deployment process for React and Flutter applications. By automating Docker configuration and Nginx setup, Vessel eliminates the complexity of production deployments and ensures best practices are followed automatically.

## Tech Stack

**Core**
- Python (CLI framework)
- Docker (Containerization)
- Nginx (Web server)
- Flask (Backend server)

**Features**
- Automated configuration generation
- Static code analysis
- Container orchestration

## Key Features

### Automated Deployment
Single-command deployment workflow that handles Docker image building, container creation, and Nginx configuration automatically.

```bash
# Deploy your React app with one command
vessel deploy

# Build configuration files
vessel build

# Manage running containers
vessel list
vessel stop <container-name>
```

### Production-Ready Configuration
Vessel generates optimized Nginx configurations with:
- Gzip compression for faster load times
- Browser caching policies
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Static asset optimization
- Industry best practices built-in

### Security Integration
Integrated with PensarAI's static code analyzer to scan for vulnerabilities before deployment, ensuring your application meets security standards.

### WSL Support
Automatic Docker installation detection and setup for Windows Subsystem for Linux environments, making it easy to deploy from any development environment.

## Architecture

Vessel follows a modular architecture that separates concerns between configuration generation, Docker orchestration, and deployment management. The tool analyzes your project structure, generates appropriate configurations, and handles the entire deployment pipeline.

```python
# Example: Vessel deployment workflow
def deploy_application(app_path):
    # Analyze project structure
    app_type = detect_application_type(app_path)

    # Generate optimized configs
    generate_nginx_config(app_type)
    generate_dockerfile(app_type)

    # Build and deploy
    build_docker_image()
    run_container()

    # Security scan
    scan_vulnerabilities()
```

## Use Cases

Perfect for developers who want to:
- Quickly deploy React or Flutter applications to production
- Maintain consistent deployment configurations across projects
- Automate DevOps workflows without complex CI/CD setup
- Ensure security and performance best practices
