## Overview

BN254 CUDA implements finite field arithmetic operations for the BN254 elliptic curve using CUDA acceleration. The project demonstrates GPU optimization techniques for cryptographic computations, serving as a foundation for Zero Knowledge Proof system acceleration.

## Tech Stack

- CUDA Toolkit 11.0+
- NVIDIA GPU (Compute capability 7.0+)
- CMake 3.18+ build system
- C++/CUDA C++

## Performance

Benchmarked on NVIDIA RTX 3080:

| Operation | Performance | CPU Speedup |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Addition | ~500 MOps/s | 20x faster |
| Multiplication | ~400 MOps/s | 50x faster |
| Montgomery Mult | ~450 MOps/s | 60x faster |

## Key Features

**Field Arithmetic**: GPU-accelerated modular addition, subtraction, and multiplication with automatic reduction and overflow handling for BN254 finite field operations.

**Montgomery Multiplication**: Optimized Montgomery form arithmetic enabling efficient batch processing of cryptographic operations without expensive modular reductions.

**Batch Processing**: Parallel computation across thousands of field elements simultaneously, maximizing GPU utilization for high-throughput cryptographic workloads.

**Educational Design**: Progressive complexity with detailed algorithm comments, debug modes, and CPU reference implementations for learning GPU optimization techniques.

## Architecture

```cpp
// Example: Batch Montgomery multiplication on GPU
__global__ void montgomery_mult_kernel(
    const FieldElement* a,
    const FieldElement* b,
    FieldElement* result,
    size_t n
) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < n) {
        result[idx] = montgomery_mult(a[idx], b[idx]);
    }
}
```
