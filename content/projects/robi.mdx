## Overview

Robi is an embedded robotics system built on Raspberry Pi hardware using C programming. The project demonstrates low-level hardware control, implementing autonomous navigation capabilities through sensor integration, PWM motor control, and real-time decision-making algorithms.

## Tech Stack

**Hardware**
- Raspberry Pi 3/4 (primary controller)
- DC motors with PWM control
- Servo motors for positioning
- Ultrasonic/IR distance sensors
- Audio output hardware

**Software**
- C programming language
- bcm2835 library (GPIO access)
- GCC compiler
- Makefile build system

## Architecture

Robi follows a modular architecture with clear separation of hardware control concerns:

```c
// Example: Motor control with PWM
void motor_control_init() {
    bcm2835_gpio_fsel(MOTOR_PIN_1, BCM2835_GPIO_FSEL_OUTP);
    bcm2835_gpio_fsel(MOTOR_PIN_2, BCM2835_GPIO_FSEL_OUTP);
    bcm2835_pwm_set_mode(0, 1, 1);
    bcm2835_pwm_set_range(0, PWM_RANGE);
}

void set_motor_speed(int speed) {
    // PWM duty cycle control for speed regulation
    bcm2835_pwm_set_data(0, speed);
}
```

### Project Structure
The codebase is organized into four functional modules:

1. **Motor Control**: DC motor speed regulation using PWM signals
2. **Servo Management**: Positioning control for directional movement
3. **Sensor Interface**: Obstacle detection and distance measurement
4. **Common Utilities**: Shared functionality and hardware abstractions

## Key Features

### PWM Motor Control
Precise speed regulation for DC motors using Pulse Width Modulation, enabling smooth acceleration, deceleration, and variable speed control for autonomous navigation.

### Servo Positioning
Accurate angular control of servo motors for steering and sensor platform orientation, allowing the robot to navigate and scan its environment.

### Obstacle Detection
Real-time sensor processing to identify obstacles and make autonomous navigation decisions. The system can detect objects in the robot's path and trigger appropriate responses.

### Audio Feedback
Integrated sound system providing operational feedback through MP3 playback, including alert sounds when obstacles are detected for debugging and demonstration purposes.

### Low-Level Hardware Control
Direct GPIO manipulation using the bcm2835 library, demonstrating understanding of embedded systems programming and hardware interfacing at the register level.

## Technical Highlights

```c
// Example: Obstacle detection and response
void autonomous_navigation() {
    while (running) {
        int distance = read_sensor();

        if (distance < OBSTACLE_THRESHOLD) {
            // Obstacle detected
            play_alert_sound();
            stop_motors();
            turn_servo(TURN_ANGLE);
            // Continue navigation
        } else {
            // Path is clear
            set_motor_speed(NORMAL_SPEED);
        }
    }
}
```

## Building and Running

```bash
# Compile the project
make

# Run the robot (requires root for GPIO access)
sudo ./robi
```

## Use Cases

This project demonstrates:
- Embedded systems development with C
- Real-time hardware control and sensor processing
- Autonomous navigation algorithm implementation
- GPIO programming and hardware interfacing
- Modular software architecture for robotics
