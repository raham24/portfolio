My ongoing master's thesis explores hardware acceleration for Zero Knowledge Proof systems, comparing existing GPU solutions to the new FPGA solutions, comparing speed metrics and accuracy.
</div>

<div className="text-center">
This is done by moving the multi-scalar multiplication for proof generation to GPU or FPGA for faster processing. Currently, <i><b>this thesis is a work in progress</b></i> and is being done to speed up Nova folding framework. The final product is expected to be 60% faster than GPU implementation.
