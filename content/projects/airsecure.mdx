- JWT-based authentication with HttpOnly cookies
- Real-time rogue access point detection
- Machine learning-powered wireless security analysis
- Role-based access control and user management
- Responsive Material UI design system
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Docker deployment support

## Overview

AirSecure is a full-stack security application that serves as the frontend for a hardware-based network security tool. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to identify malicious wireless networks, including rogue access points and evil twin attacks.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- Material UI
- Emotion styling

**Backend**
- Next.js API Routes
- Python ML Engine
- PostgreSQL database

**Security**
- JWT authentication
- HttpOnly cookie sessions
- Protected route middleware

## Architecture

The application follows a modular, extensible architecture with clear separation of concerns. The frontend communicates with a Python-based machine learning engine that processes wireless network data and identifies potential security threats.

```typescript
// Example: Protected API route
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const session = await verifySession(request);

  if (!session) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
  }

  // Process security data
  const threats = await detectThreats();
  return Response.json(threats);
}
```

## Features

### Security Detection
Real-time monitoring and detection of malicious wireless networks through hardware-based scanning and machine learning analysis.

### User Management
Complete user registration, authentication, and profile management with role-based access control for team collaboration.

### Data Visualization
Interactive dashboards displaying network security metrics, threat analytics, and historical detection data.
