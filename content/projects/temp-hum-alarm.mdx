- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- WPA2 Enterprise network support (eduroam)
- Configurable alarm thresholds
- Web-based interface for visualization
- ESP32 microcontroller with DHT sensor
- RESTful API for remote monitoring

## Overview

An embedded IoT system built on ESP32 that monitors environmental conditions and triggers alarms based on configurable temperature and humidity thresholds. Supports enterprise network authentication for institutional deployment.

## Tech Stack

- ESP32 microcontroller
- DHT11/DHT22 sensor
- PlatformIO framework
- C++ (96%), C (4%)
- WPA2 Enterprise WiFi

## Key Features

**Environmental Monitoring**: Continuous temperature and humidity tracking using DHT sensors with real-time data collection and processing on the ESP32 platform.

**Enterprise Network Support**: WPA2 Enterprise authentication compatible with eduroam and institutional networks, enabling deployment in academic and corporate environments.

**Configurable Alerts**: Threshold-based alarm system with customizable temperature and humidity limits for flexible monitoring applications.

**Web Interface**: Companion web UI for remote data visualization, system control, and alarm configuration through RESTful API endpoints.

## Applications

Suitable for server room monitoring, greenhouse automation, laboratory environmental control, and smart building management systems.

## Mobile Interface

See the companion [React Native mobile app](temp-hum-alarm-app) for remote monitoring and control capabilities.
