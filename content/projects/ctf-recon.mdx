- Directory and file enumeration with custom wordlists
- Parameter fuzzing for injection testing
- Subdomain discovery with DNS resolution
- Port scanning with banner grabbing
- Multi-threaded concurrent scanning
- HTTP security header analysis

## Overview

CTF Recon is a Python-based reconnaissance tool designed for Capture The Flag competitions and authorized penetration testing. The tool automates discovery of hidden infrastructure through directory enumeration, parameter fuzzing, subdomain scanning, and port analysis.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.6+
- requests library for HTTP operations
- Multi-threaded architecture for concurrent scanning
- Custom wordlists (600+ directories, 400+ parameters, 350+ subdomains)

## Key Features

**Directory Enumeration**: Automated discovery of hidden directories and files using brute force with customizable wordlists and file extension support.

**Parameter Fuzzing**: GET/POST parameter discovery to identify potential injection points and hidden functionality.

**Subdomain Discovery**: DNS-based subdomain enumeration to map target infrastructure and identify additional attack surfaces.

**Port Scanning**: Network port analysis with banner grabbing to fingerprint services and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Performance Optimization**: Configurable threading (default: 20 threads) and timeout settings for optimal scanning speed across different network conditions.

## Usage

```bash
# Directory scan
python3 ctf_recon.py -u https://target.com -d

# Parameter fuzzing
python3 ctf_recon.py -u https://target.com -p

# Subdomain enumeration
python3 ctf_recon.py -u target.com -s

# Port scanning
python3 ctf_recon.py -u target.com -P

# Combined scan with custom threads
python3 ctf_recon.py -u https://target.com -d -p -t 30
```

## Applications

Designed for CTF competitions, authorized security assessments, penetration testing engagements, and security research environments.
