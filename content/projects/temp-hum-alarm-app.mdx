- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Dual unit display (Celsius/Fahrenheit)
- Heat index calculations
- Remote control for alarm, LED, and display
- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
- RESTful API integration with ESP32

## Overview

A React Native mobile application providing a real-time monitoring interface for the [ESP32 Temperature & Humidity Alarm System](temp-hum-alarm). The app enables remote environmental monitoring and device control through a clean, responsive interface.

## Tech Stack

- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript
- RESTful API integration
- Tab-based navigation
- Service layer architecture

## Key Features

**Real-Time Monitoring**: Live temperature and humidity data with automatic polling and dual unit display supporting both Celsius and Fahrenheit measurements with heat index calculations.

**Remote Control**: Toggle switches for alarm activation, LED indicators, and display control, enabling full device management from the mobile interface.

**Connection Management**: Automatic connection status tracking with built-in error handling and retry logic for reliable communication with ESP32 hardware.

**Cross-Platform**: Single codebase supporting iOS, Android, and web platforms through Expo's unified development framework.

## Architecture

```typescript
// ESP32 API Service Layer
const fetchSensorData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${ESP32_URL}/sensor`);
  return await response.json();
};

const toggleAlarm = async (state: boolean) => {
  await fetch(`${ESP32_URL}/alarm`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ enabled: state })
  });
};
```

## Integration

This mobile app serves as the companion interface for the [Temperature & Humidity Alarm System](temp-hum-alarm), providing remote monitoring and control capabilities for the ESP32-based hardware.
